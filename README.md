# Machine Learning Club Assignment

I am Mihir Agarwal, a second year undergrduate at IIT Gandhinagar. This is my assignment submission for the Machine Learning Club Secretary 2023.

The questions have been arranged in the respective folders.


- [x] Q1
- [x] Q2
- [x] Q3
- [x] Q4 


I have used the following resources as reference:

- Probabilistic Machine Learning: An Introduction by Kevin Murphy
- CS229 Course by Anand Avati (link: https://cs229.stanford.edu/syllabus-summer2019.html)
- Pytorch Documentation
- ChatGPT (Super Useful!)
- Pytorch Geometric Documentation

I have tried to write device agnostic codes, so you will not need to change the code.

It is a very difficult to include a requirements.txt file, as I have used a huge number of libraries and pytorch_geomtric installation is a bit tricky.
